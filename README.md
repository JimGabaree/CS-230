The Gaming Room is a game development company that is wanting to expand their gaming network to include multiple platforms.
I feel like I gave the client solid information on how to proceed with making their current game availble to a wide range of platforms.
I found that creating a basic UML diagram was the most influential step in creating the Software Design Templey.
I would choose to revice the code. I feel like I did an underpar job notating the code which could cause an issue for another member of my team to follow.
For one the user had contacted us with their needs so it was imperative that we supplied them with a product that met their specifications. Their needs were laid out extremely well so it did not leave much open to interpretation.
I would still stick with creating an initial UML Diagram of the program. I would then maintain an open line of communication with my client to ensure their needs are being met.
